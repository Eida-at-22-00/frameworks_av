        This (and above) are actually served as part of the swcodec APEX.
        However, this was one of the first APEXEes, so they were created
        before APEX supported VINTF manifest. So, devices have old manifest
        entries, and the manifest is not in the APEX. The manifest also
        does not contain updatable-via-apex until Android 16 (B). Because of
        this, if the version is updated, vts_treble_vintf_vendor_test may
        fail on old devices which have the updated mainline module. If the
        manifest entry is conditionally added to the APEX, so that it is only
        read on new devices, we could move this entry from the platform into
        the APEX.
